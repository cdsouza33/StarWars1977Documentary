                        This documentary opened our eyes to the ingenuity and feats of engineering that were behind the production of the first Star Wars movie. Some novel concepts that were implemented in while making this movie included:

                    <li>
                        One example of this is the layering of different visuals to create one cohesive shot. The synthesis of shots with the actors, the Millennium Falcon, the death star, and the star field all came together one on top of each other to create “the shot”
